  <h1>What is a Star?</h1>
  <p><img src=stars.jpg height=20% width=20% alt="Stars in the Sky" title="Stars are all types of shapes and sizes."/></p>
   <p class="1">
    As star is a sphere of gas <a href="http://www.space.com/17170-what-is-the-sun-made-of.html">hydrogen and helium</a> which has a lot of energy. </p>
    A star is not like a planet because it produces light unlike a planet that can only reflect it. It produces energy, heat, and light by a process called nuclear fusion.
   </p> 
   <p class="2">
    This happens when “lighter elements are forced to become heavier elements.” Basically they form from “huge interstellar gas
    clouds.” As the gravity increases on these clouds, the density increases which causes more heat and burns the hydrogen into 
    helium. Because of this, a lot of energy is made and causes the gas to heat up and shine. Thus forming a star. This process 
    can take 100 million years for a star to form.

  <h3>Our Sun</h3>
   <p>
    Our sun is an example of a star. It is considered an average size star. Stars can be 
    bigger, hotter, brighter, cooler and different colors than our sun. The biggest star 
    known, could be up to 150 times greater than the sun (called Eta Carinae). There are 
    certain types of stars that could be trillions of years old. When you look up into the 
    sky and see the tiny star, it really does have a lot more history than one gives 
    it credit for.
