Stary Sky(stars.jpg)

<p>As star is a sphere of gas (hydrogen and helium) that has a lot of energy. A star is not like a planet because it produces 
light other than a planet that can only reflect it. It produces energy, heat, and light by a process called nuclear fusion.
This happens when “lighter elements are forced to become heavier elements.” Basically they form from “huge interstellar gas
clouds.” As the gravity increases on these clouds, the density increases which causes more heat which burns the hydrogen into 
helium. Because of this, a lot of energy is made and causes the gas to heat up and shine. Thus forming a star. This process 
can take 100 million years for a star to form.</p>

Did you know that our sun was a <a href=star.html>star?</a>

<h3>Our Sun</h3>

 is an example of a star. It is considered an average size star. Stars can be bigger, hotter, brighter, cooler and different colors than our sun. The biggest star known, could be up to 150 times greater than the sun (called Eta Carinae). There are certain types of stars that could be trillions of years old. When you look up into the sky and see the tiny star, it really does have a lot more history than one gives it credit for.

 Did you that our sun is involved in many experiments?<a href=method.html>"See how"</a>
